# Faculty Student Database Management System with Cloud Integration and Automated Data Extraction

## Description
The Faculty Student Database Management System is a software application designed to manage student data for various departments within a university. The system includes cloud integration, which allows for locally maintained data to be transferred to a cloud database for web serving. The web server allows teachers to access student data online.

One of the key features of the system is its ability to automate the process of extracting data from multiple CSV files, and uploading it to the cloud for web serving. This automation saves time and reduces the risk of errors that could occur during manual data extraction and uploading.

To ensure that the faculty is aware of the progress of the data extraction and uploading process, the system is designed to send notifications once the process is finished. This feature helps to ensure that the faculty can plan their activities around the availability of the updated student data.

To enhance the speed of data serving on the web, the system makes use of the grid.js library for server-side rendering. This library is known for its high performance and efficient rendering of large datasets. The use of this library ensures that the student data is displayed quickly and efficiently on the web server.

Overall, the Faculty Student Database Management System is a powerful tool for managing student data. With its cloud integration, automated data extraction, and use of the grid.js library for server-side rendering, the system is designed to be efficient, reliable, and easy to use.

*Note :- Please be advised that the Faculty Student Database Management System described above is still under development, and there are plans to add more features and enhancements in the future. Our team is working diligently to ensure that the system meets the needs of our users and provides a seamless experience for managing student data. We appreciate your patience and look forward to sharing updates on the progress of this project.*
